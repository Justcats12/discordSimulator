Using Discord Simulator by @Daylightgaming69

Please don't share the software to random people.

make sure to replace every file and download all new files. (if you have no /img/ folder make a new folder and call it "img")

INSTRUCTIONS:
Click "edit" to edit, click again to stop editing
Click the "add post" button to add a post. You can remove or move posts.
Click "save" to save the current screen (it will remain after shutting down unless you use a different browser). 
Click "add line" to add another line to a post
Put all your images in the /img/ folder. This version is only compatible with .png files. 
For profile pictures, give your file the name <username>.png.
Use the slider to change the users name color 
To post an image, put the file name in the settings bar (right).
You can change the name in the "<user> is typing..." place
SETTINGS:
add the following lines to the settings line for the corresponding results
bot: adds the bot tag to a post, this makes it look like the post was made by a bot
file: adds a custom file, you can change the name and the file size
<filename>.png: displays the image if it is in the /img/ folder
CALL SIMULATOR;
Fill in the names of the two callers in the 2 callsetting boxes
You can use the sliders to puppeteer the users

TIP: while filming zoom can give you better quality shots :D
